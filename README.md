# JsxReactProject
 Play around with some React components and JSX.
 
Instructions:

 ·Create a project using create-react-app

·Create App.js in the src folder and use it as a root component for your React app.

· Create a file called product.js with a json object of a product’s name, price, description, and a path or URL to an image. (Don’t forget to export the json object)

· Create four components that return the product’s name, price, description, and image. (Name.js, Price.js, Description.js, and Image.js)

· Export all your components so that they can be used in the root component (in App.js)

· Import the json object created previously into all newly created components.

· Create a card that contains all components created using react-bootstrap in your App.js.
